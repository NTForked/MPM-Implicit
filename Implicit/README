# Notes on the code:
	- main file and MPM Source files are in cartesian/src.
	- Example input files can be found in bin
	- Material files are included in cartesian/material  (Isotropic linear elastic, Mohr-Coulomb, CamClay, Bingham fluid model)
	- Code is written for 2D / 3D. 
	- If you do any changes in the source files don't change the original source files. Include the additional things in derived classes.
	- Corlib template files are a property of Dr. Fehmi Cirak. Therefore please make sure that you do not give this code to anyone without the permission from Dr. Fehmi Cirak and Prof. Kenichi Soga.
	- You need 'boost' library. This code is currently configured to run on *nix systems. But you can refer the documentation to get an idea of it.

Feel free to contact me at kks32@cam.ac.uk if you need any assistance with the code. 

# Prerequisites:

* You need BOOST Libraries installed on your machine, to install Boost in Fedora: type 'yum install boost-devel.x86_64' in the terminal without quotes

* TCLAP (http://tclap.sourceforge.net/)[http://tclap.sourceforge.net/]

* Corlib FE Template Library by Fehmi Cirak 

# Installation Instructions if you already have a configure file: (detailed installation instructions see Install)

1. Run ./configure --with-corlib=/path_to/corlib --with-tclap=/path/to/tclap on the terminal
2. make 

# If you don't have a configure file or would like to regenerate the configure files:
0. Remove aclocal.m4, autom4te.cache and configure files (if present)
1. Run 'aclocal -I m4/' on the terminal
2. Run 'autoconf' on the terminal
3. Run 'automake' on the terminal to generate the configure 

# Cleaning Make and Target files
1. type "make clean" on terminal without quotes to remove the executable 
2. type "make distclean" on terminal without quotes to remove objects, executable(s) and configuration files

#If you have modified/removed/added new *.hpp or *.ipp files: (To generate a configure file)
1. Add the *.hpp or *.ipp to Makefile.am in the Code\ directory
2. Run 'aclocal -I m4', 'autoconf' and 'automake' to generate the configure script.
3. Follow the Installation Instructions, when you have a configure file
